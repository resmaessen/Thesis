Metrices to compare the skill
- Fourier series (how is the behavior) -> There are package available for this (oscillator to examine  -> is similar)
- Minium jerk model
- TRY TO FIND SOME MORE!

- overlap between the signals (original and current one)
- amplitude (stiffnes and position, might be usefull for stifness to examin maximum stiffness)

check out PEAKS (of matlab) if existi in python tells how many peaks there are in the signal 


High level frequency


Keep conditions structured
- Features to look at
- And tools


- Condtion
- Feature of skill 

Maybe not use a human at all. because frequency becomes annyoing.
