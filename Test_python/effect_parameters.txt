____________________
h

dy can be larger when h is larger -> steepness is larger
so if Kmax -> 0 is desired, it goes much faster,
thus the learning is more reactive
 





____________________
N
amount of peaks (much more if N becomes larger)
advantage: large N result in better stiffness
disadvantage: larg N can result in overfitting



____________________
e_th
changes in stifness scheme
if larger K tries to go to 0 more often
due to which the difference compared to the desired trajectory becomes larger
which result in the error being larger
and thus the stiffness goes more often to Kmax
